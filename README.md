# Parallel Sort Algorithm Analysis

Implementations of various parallel sorting algorithms in OpenMP.

## Algorithms Included

* [Batcher's Bitonic Sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bitonic_sorter)
* Bucket Sort
* Even Odd Sort
* Insertion Sort
* Sequential Quick Sort
* Shell Sort

## Steps to build/run locally on a Mac

* install [homebrew](http://brew.sh/)
* open a terminal
* brew reinstall gcc --without-multilib **(NOTE: This will take a loooong time, around 30 minutes)**
* navigate to the project directory
* type `make` to build
* type `./app.out` to run the program
